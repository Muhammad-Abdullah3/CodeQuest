/*Write a Java program that demonstrates passing arrays via methods. 
  Create a class called "ArrayModifier" with a method named "incrementElements" that takes 
  an integer array as a parameter and increments each element in the array by 1. Test this method 
  by creating an object of the ArrayModifier class, 
  initializing an integer array, and passing it to the "incrementElements" method.*/
